        <li>Drug overdose death rates increased for all age groups, with the greatest percentage increase among adults aged 55–64 (from 4.2 per 100,000 in 1999 to 21.8 in 2015). In 2015, adults aged 45–54 had the highest rate (30.0).</li>
        <li>In 2015, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths among non-Hispanic white persons (21.1 per 100,000) was nearly 3.5 times the rate in 1999 (6.2).</li>
        <li>The four states with the highest age-adjusted drug overdose death rates in 2015 were West Virginia (41.5), New Hampshire (34.3), Kentucky (29.9), and Ohio (29.9).</li>

    <h2 class="why">Why Laced Heroin Is More Dangerous and Increases Risk of Opioid Overdose</h2>
    <p class="info">Regular heroin obtained on the street is derived from the poppy 
      plant. Manufacturers “cook” heroin before selling it on the black 
      market. Heroin itself is dangerous, as it is a central nervous 
      system depressant. This means that it slows heart rate and breathing, 
      leading to potentially deadly consequences. Furthermore, heroin is 
      highly addictive, leading to compulsive drug-seeking behavior that 
      individuals have difficulty controlling.</p>
    <p class="info">As dangerous as heroin alone can be, it is even more dangerous 
      when laced with other substances. Heroin is most commonly laced 
      with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid made in laboratories. Fentanyl 
      can be 100 times as potent as morphine and 50 times as powerful as 
      heroin. A related substance called carfentanyl is 100 times more 
      powerful than fentanyl, making it very dangerous.</p>
    <p class="info">Because fentanyl and carfentanyl are produced in illicit labs, 
      their potency and quality is not well controlled. Furthermore, 
      people purchasing laced heroin on the street may be unaware that 
      the drug is laced with these more powerful substances. This means 
      that only a small amount of the drug can have deadly consequences. 
      The Drug Enforcement Agency reports that Mexican cartels have 
      accelerated smuggling of fentanyl over the past two years, which may 
      be leading to the clusters of opioid-related overdose deaths 
      occurring across the country.</p>
    <p class="info">In some cases, heroin may also be laced with cocaine, which is a 
      central nervous system stimulant. Mixing a stimulant with a 
      depressant can be particularly dangerous, as this combination can 
      have very unpredictable effects.</p>
